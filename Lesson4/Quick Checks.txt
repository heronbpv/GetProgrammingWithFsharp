Quick check 4.1 answers:
1 - Give at least two examples of values that can be bound to symbols with let 
A - Primitive values, like int and float, and objects, like those from the BCL (e.g.: System.Random). More importantly to fsharp, let bindings can be associated with functions.

2 - What’s the difference between let and var ?
A - A let binding makes for an immutable association, whereas var is mutable.

3 - Is F# a static or dynamic language?
A - Static.

Quick check 4.2 answers:
1 - How do you indicate a new scope in F#?
A - Through the use of indentation.

2 - Can you declare functions within a nested scope?
A - Yes, all the way through.

3 - Do we normally need to use the return keyword to return from a scope?
A - Not, unless inside a computation expression. The last value or expression (which will be evaluated to a value before exit), but not binding, of a function is regarded as it's return value automaticaly by the compiler.
