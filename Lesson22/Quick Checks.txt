Quick check 22.1 answers:
1 - Why can’t C# prevent obvious null references?
A - Because objects in C# can be assigned null at any time. There's no way to treat a class as non-nullable.

2 - How does the nullable type improve matters when working with data that might be missing?
A - By encapsulating the value, and provinding an API over it to verify it's nullability.

Quick check 22.2 answers:
1 - Can you get null reference exceptions in F#?
A - Yes, although it's less likely if you stick with the F# types (and don't deal with raw strings, e.g.)

2 - How should you safely dereference a value that’s wrapped in an option?
A - By pattern matching over it.

Quick check 22.3 answers:
1 - When should you use Option.map rather than an explicit pattern match?
A - When you only have two cases on the pattern match, for some and none, and the none case returns none.

2 - What’s the difference between Option.map and bind?
A - Map only lifts the result value to the world of options, by applying the mapping function, whereas bind flattens chaining option types (e.g. Option<Option<int>> turns into Option<int>) after applying the binding function.
