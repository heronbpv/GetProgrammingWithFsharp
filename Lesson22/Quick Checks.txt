Quick check 22.1 answers:
1 - Why can’t C# prevent obvious null references?
A - Because objects in C# can be assigned null at any time. There's no way to treat a class as non-nullable.

2 - How does the nullable type improve matters when working with data that might be missing?
A - By encapsulating the value, and provinding an API over it to verify it's nullability.
