Quick check 36.1 answers:
1 - What’s the preferred type to use in .NET when executing work in the background?
A - A Task. Or more specifically, the type System.Threading.Tasks.Task.

2 - What’s the difference between CPU- and I/O-bound workloads in terms of their activity on a thread?
A - CPU-bound workloads are computations that take a long time to complete, thus blocking other processes waiting for CPU time to be freed. This makes the thread they're in to remain on hold until the computation ends. 
I/O-bound computations, on the other hand, are waiting for a external call to respond to it's request, blocking further processing until said call is answered. In that way, the thread responsible for this process will be left idle until the return is given.

1 - What extra keyword must you use in async blocks to return a value?
A - The return keyword. Which is just a syntatic sugar for a call to the Return function of the AsyncBuilder class, treated as a reserved word by the F# compiler as part of the Computation Expression functionality!

2 - Do async workflows immediately execute on creation?
A - No, they don't. One must explicitly call a executing function (e.g. Start or RunSynchronously) from the Async module.
