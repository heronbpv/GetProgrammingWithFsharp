Quick check 34.1 answers:
1 - Can you use connection strings with type providers?
A - Yes.

2 - Name one benefit of using connection strings with type providers.
A - The connection string is not hardcoded and, thus, can be altered at runtime (e.g. in a deployed environment).

3 - When should you not use connection strings with type providers?
A - From scripts, since they work with fsi.exe and it, in turn, is it's own .net application, complete with a app.config. This way, when you reference a connection string expected to be in the app.config file, inside a script, and then send it to fsi.exe, the app.config been look at is, by default, the fsi one.

Quick check 34.2 answers:
1 - Why is it good practice to decouple your data access code from a connection string?
A - To avoid conflict of usage between compiled application code and script coding. The decopling makes it possible to both sources to use the same system, without generating a negative impact in either.

Quick check 34.3 answer:
1 - Why is creating a CI process sometimes more work when using type providers?
A - Because of the need for a data source to be present at both compile and runtime in order for the type provider to generate the types correctly during the build process.
